   Modular robot morphological measures.

   Only works for robot with only right angle module rotations (90 degrees).
   Some measures only work for 2d robots, which is noted in their docstring.

   The measures are based on the following paper:
   Miras, K., Haasdijk, E., Glette, K., Eiben, A.E. (2018).
   Search Space Analysis of Evolvable Robot Morphologies.
