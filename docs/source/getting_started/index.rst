Revolve2 is research software designed for the optimization of modular robot designs, both in terms of their physical structures (bodies) and their behaviour (brains). It primarily employs evolutionary algorithms for optimization, although other techniques can be used as well. Furthermore, Revolve2 offers capabilities to test these robots in simulation as well as in the real-world.

The software comes with several packages. Depending on your research needs, you may choose to work with a specific subset of these packages.
This tutorial will guide you through the key steps to initiate your studies and research using Revolve2 efficiently.

--------------------
Step 1: Installation
--------------------
The first step is to install Revolve2. For this follow the detailed tutorial from :doc:`Installation Guide </installation/index>`.
Keep in mind that installation can vary depending on the release you choose. This documentation matches the latest release of Revolve2.

------------------------------
Step 2: Play with the examples
------------------------------
Based on your research topic, certain functionalities in Revolve2 may be of interest to you.
A good starting point to delve deeper into Revolve2's inner workings is the example directory found in the repository.
Some examples come in two versions: one with and one without a database.
It is recommended to explore the examples without the database first to better grasp the significance of this addition.
