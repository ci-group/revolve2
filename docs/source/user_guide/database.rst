Database
========
All results and state in Revolve2 are stored using a database.
Revolve2 provides no specific interface to this database; instead this is handled by the SQLAlchemy library.
See `<https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_.
All databases supported by SQLAlchemy can be used, but as long as you have no specific requirements SQLite is recommended.
