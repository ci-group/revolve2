Modular robots
==============
Revolve2 provides a framework for modular robotics.
This will eventually be moved out of the core package or made more generic as it is specific to CI Group, but for now it remains.
See the :ref:`Simulate robot isaac tutorial<tutorials/simulate_robot_isaac:Creating a modular robot and simulating and visualizing it in the Isaac Gym environment>` for how to use this framework.
