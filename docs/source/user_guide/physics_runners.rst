Physics runners
===============
Physics running is the act of measuring the physical behaviour of an environment over time.
This can be either in simulation or reality, although currently only simulation is supported.

Revolve2 provides the interface ``Runner`` that can run multiple environments in parallel using a ``Batch`` of ``Environments``.
An environment is a collection of dynamic and static objects of which some are controllable actors.
