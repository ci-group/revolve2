In this example you set up a trivial experiment with muliple repetitions.
To change the experiments parameters, adjust the values in `config.py`.

You learn:
- Setting up an experiment.
- Basic use of logging.
- Experiment repetitions.
- About the random number generator and reproducible experiments.
- In particular, you will NOT learn how to save your experiment results.
  Either use your own preferred method, or look at the SQLAlchemy database abstraction commonly used in Revolve2.

You can change the configuration of the experiment in `config.py`.
