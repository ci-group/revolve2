In this example you simulate a multiple robots in the same scene, and then calculate their x-y displacement.
Since the robots are within one scene, they can interact with one another.

First see the `3c_evaluate_multiple_isolated_robots` example.
This example is extremely similar, but will ommit some of the commentary.

You learn:
- How to put multiple robots in the same scene.
- How to process the simulation results.
