## 3) Learn how to properly setup experiments
Simulating robots on its own is not that useful, so we actually want to make experiments that show us cool new things we did not know before.
Here you will learn about a few things that are important in almost all experimental setups.

- In `3a_experiment_setup` you will learn a way to structure a basic experiment in revolve2. Make sure to understand this example well.
- In `3b_evaluate_single_robot` we will see how you can evaluate robots in ane experiment.
- Since evaluating one robot is not very interesting in `3c_evaluate_multiple_isolated_robots` you will see how this evaluation can be done for a population of robots.
- Alternatively if you want multiple robots interacting with each other look into example `3d_evaluate_multiple_interacting_robots`.
