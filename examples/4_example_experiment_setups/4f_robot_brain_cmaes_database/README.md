This is the `robot_brain_cmaes` example, but with added saving of results to a database.

Definitely first look at the `4e_robot_brain_cmaes` and `4b_simple_ea_xor_database` examples.
Many explanation comments are omitted here.

To visualize the evolved robots, use `rerun.py` with the parameters you got from evolution.
Running `plot.py` allows you to plot the robots fitness metrics over each generation.
