In this example you will learn how to create N random robots, starting from their genotypes and the process of mapping them into
phenotypes and finally robots in order to asses the "quality" of your initial population and individual morphological traits.

You learn:
- How to generate N random genotypes (where N is set in config.py).
- How to develop the genotypes into phenotypes to form robots.
- How to visualize such robots to asses their morphologies
- How to use the "MorphologicalMeasures" class to calculate different morpholoical traits of individuals.
- How to use such measures to compute population metrics, such as diversity.
