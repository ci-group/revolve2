## 4) Lets look into more complex experiment setups
Most projects require some more complex setups to make them interesting research. 
In this collection of examples we will show how such setups can be made and how you can incorporate databases for easy data collection.
Additionally you will learn hwo to use the evolution abstraction layer in Revolve2.

- `4a_simlpe_ea_xor` gives you a quick introduction on how you can setup a simple evolutionary algorithm for optimization.
- In `4b_simple_ea_xor_database` we use the same logic as in the example before, but add a database to collect the information.
- `4c_robot_bodybrain_ea` shows you how to use more abstraction objects and specifies how to optimize the brain and body of modular robots.
- `4d_robot_bodybrain_ea_database` is the same example, with the addition of databases to allow for data storage.
- If you want to add learning into your experiments look at `4e_robot_brain_cmaes`, in which we add learning to a **single** robot.
- `4f_robot_brain_cmaes_database` does the same thing as the previous example with the addition of a database.
