## 5) Put your evolved robots into the real world.
Simply simulating all your experiments might not be enough. 
To validate if the experiments can reproduce on actual physical robots, you first need to build the robot.
If you dont know how to start with this visit the [Revolve2 Documentation](https://ci-group.github.io/revolve2/). 
Specifically look at *Creating a physical robot* and *Physical Robot Core Setup*.

- In `5a_physical_robot_remote` you learn how to control your newly built robot remotely.
- In `5b_compare_simulated_and_physical_robot` you will be able to check whether your built robot has ben built correctly, by comparing it to the simulation counterpart.
