In this example you create a physical robot with a simulated twin.
You will use two separate scripts, one for the simulated robot and one for the physical robot.
With this duplicate you can check whether you have built the physical robot correctly.

If hinges in the simulation behave exactly the opposite as on the physical robot you can adjust them without rebuilding using the inverting function, as shown in the example.

You learn:
- How to validate the physical robot with simulations.
- How to use inverting functionality for quick fixes.
