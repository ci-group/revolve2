In this example you simulate a multiple robots in the same scne, and then calculate their xy displacement.

First see the 'evaluate_multiple_isolated_robots' example.
This example is extremely similar, but will ommit some of the commentary.

You learn:
- How to put multiple robots in the same scene.
- How to process the simulation results.
