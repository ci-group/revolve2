In this example, you will control a physical modular robot by running its brain locally on your computer and streaming movement instructions to the physical modular robot.

You learn:
- How to create a configuration describing how a physical modular robot should be controlled.
- How to remote control a physical modular robot using this configuration.

Requirements:
- A physical modular robot. Note whether you are using V1 or V2 hardware; If you do not know, it is probably V2. TODO in the next version of Revolve2 a guide will be added on how to build a physical robot. For now, ask the CI Group lab.
- The modular robot body and brain defined in a Revolve2 ModularRobot object. It is recommended that you test it in simulation first. The code in this example shows you how to create a ModularRobot as well.
- Understanding of simulation and other examples related to simulation will greatly help with your understanding of this example.

The rest of this example is contained in the `main.py` file.
