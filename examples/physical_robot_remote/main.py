    Some important notes to understand:
    - Hinge mappings are specific to each robot, so they have to be created new for each type of body. 
    - The pin`s id`s can be found on th physical robots HAT.
    - The order of the pin`s is crucial for a correct translation into the physical robot.
    - Each ActiveHinge needs one corresponding pin to be able to move. 
    - If the mapping is faulty check the simulators behavior versus the physical behavior and adjust the mapping iteratively.
    
    For a concrete implementation look at the following example of mapping the robots`s hinges:
    """
    hinge_1, hinge_2, hinge_3, hinge_4 = hinges
    hinge_mapping = {
        UUIDKey(hinge_1): 21,
        UUIDKey(hinge_2): 26,
        UUIDKey(hinge_3): 20,
        UUIDKey(hinge_4): 21,
    }

    """
    A configuration consists of the follow parameters:
    - modular_robot: The ModularRobot object, exactly as you would use it in simulation.
    - hinge_mapping: This maps active hinges to GPIO pins on the physical modular robot core.
    - run_duration: How long to run the robot for in seconds.
    - control_frequency: Frequency at which to call the brain control functions in seconds. If you also ran the robot in simulation, this must match your setting there.
    - initial_hinge_positions: Initial positions for the active hinges. In Revolve2 the simulator defaults to 0.0.
    - inverse_servos: Sometimes servos on the physical robot are mounted backwards by accident. Here you inverse specific servos in software. Example: {13: True} would inverse the servo connected to GPIO pin 13.
