"""
This is the 'robot_brain_cmaes' example, but with added saving of results to a database.

Definitely first look at the 'robot_brain_cmaes' and 'simple_ea_xor_database' examples.
Many explanation comments are omitted here.

You learn:
- Nothing new in particular, but this can be a good starting point for your own experiments.
