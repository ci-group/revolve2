Here you will optimize a neural network to calculate XOR, using an evolutionary algorithm.

To better understand, first look at the `experiment_setup` example.

You learn:
- How to create a simple evolutionary loop.

The evaluation of the neural network is done in `evaluate.py`.<br/>
In `config.py` you can adjust parameter.<br/>
`genotype.py` houses all representations and functionality behind a robots genotypes.<br/>
In `individual.py` you find a class that stores individual robots.
