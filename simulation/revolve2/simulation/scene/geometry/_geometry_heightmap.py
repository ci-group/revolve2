    A heightmap geometry.

    Similarly to the `Plane` geometry, x and y of `size` define the space the heighmap encompasses.
    The z-coordinate defines the height of a heightmap edge when it's value is maximum.
    `heights` defines the edge of the heighmap. Values much lie between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
    `base_thickness` defines the thickness of the box below the heighmap, which is requires for proper collision detection in some simulators.
